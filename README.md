These are some code samples I pulled together to help find some problematic label class properties with one of my projects. The challenge was finding specific label class properties in a very complex map with nearly 100 layers and numerous label classes per layer.

I intially used an exported MAPX for a JSON only solution (mapx_json_search.py); but also wanted to leverage the CIM helper classes in arcpy.mp with the aprx_arcpymp_search.py.
